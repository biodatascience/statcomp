### Texts

There are no required texts for this course.  Any texts referenced in class lecture are either published online as open-access material or are available as free E-books through UNC libraries.  

### Objective and description

This class teaches important concepts and skills for statistical
computing, numerical optimization, and machine learning using case
studies. After this course, students will have a good understanding of
the process of producing high-quality and sharable statistical
programs (module 1, 3 weeks), algorithms for optimization and numerical integration (module 2, 6 weeks), and
will be able to implement and apply some common and powerful machine
learning methods (module 3, 3 weeks).  Modules 1 and 3 were originally developed by [Dr. Michael Love](https://mikelove.github.io). 

### Content

In this class, students will learn:

* How to write efficient and sharable statistical programs for scientific research
* Various optimization and numerical integration algorithms
* How to implement and use common and powerful machine learning methods

### Prerequisites - strictly enforced

* [BIOS 663 & 760 (or 762 if Bios DrPH)](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/courses/) 
* One programming class at the undergraduate level or [BIOS 611](https://biodatascience.github.io/datasci611/)
* Prior R experience is required, familiarity with [basic R functions](https://github.com/biodatascience/compbio_src/blob/master/eda/functions.md)
* Basic knowledge of the Linux environment

* [BIOS 651 - Principles of Machine Learning](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/courses/)

### Graded work
 
The class will be taught through three modules. One final project
(30%), an initial proposal for the final project (10%), a final presentation (20%), and weekly homework assignments (40%) will make up the final grade for the course.  The initial proposal (due March 10th) can be resubmitted for a regrade as many times as desired up until March 31st.  

At the beginning of the course, students will learn to create an R
package which they will update as the class progresses, implementing
the methods they learn in each module. This R package will be
applied to each project and homework assignment. Each student's R
package will be hosted and iteratively updated on GitHub. Homework
and projects will be similarly submitted to course instructors through
GitHub Classrooms.

Grading scale:

* H: Clear excellence
* P: Entirely satisfactory
* L: Low passing
* F: Fail

The School of Public Health grading system is designed so that the
mode of the grading distribution is P. The last graded assignment will
be due on the last week of regular classes. 

*Homework policy* - students are allowed and encouraged to talk about ideas and approaches to homework problems in groups, though students should write up the code for the assignments **independently**. Copying someone else’s work is always an honor code violation.  Expulsion from the university is possible if the honor code is violated, and receiving 0% on the assignment in question is a certainty.
