* One programming class at the undergraduate level or [BIOS 611](https://biodatascience.github.io/datasci611/)

* [BIOS 651 - Principles of Machine Learning](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/courses/)

### Texts

There are no required texts for this course.  Any texts referenced in class lecture are either published online as open-access material or are available as free E-books through UNC libraries.

### Course Overview

This class teaches important concepts and skills for statistical
computing, numerical optimization, and machine learning using case
studies. After this course, students will have a good understanding of
the process of producing high-quality and sharable statistical
programs (module 1, 3 weeks), algorithms for optimization and numerical integration (module 2, 6 weeks), and will be able to implement and apply some common and powerful machine
learning methods (module 3, 3 weeks).  Modules 1 and 3 were originally developed by [Dr. Michael Love](https://mikelove.github.io). 

### Learning Objectives

In this class, students will learn:

* How to write efficient and sharable statistical programs for scientific research
* Various optimization and numerical integration algorithms
* How to implement and use common and powerful machine learning methods

### Graded work
 
The class will be taught through three modules. One final project
(30%), an initial proposal for the final project (10%), a final presentation (20%), and weekly homework assignments (40%) will make up the final grade for the course.  The initial proposal (due March 10th) can be resubmitted for a regrade as many times as desired up until March 31st.  

At the beginning of the course, students will learn to create an R
package which they will update as the class progresses, implementing
the methods they learn in each module. This R package will be
applied to each project and homework assignment. Each student's R
package will be hosted and iteratively updated on GitHub. Homework
and projects will be similarly submitted to course instructors through
GitHub Classrooms.  

Each student will also be assigned a Virtual Machine (VM) that contains all necessary software to run the course notes, examples, homework assignments, and class projects.  Students are also encouraged to install required course software locally on their own computers, where the VM provides an alternative if installation issues arise. Instructions for how to log into the VM will be sent out the first week of classes.  The VM instances are hosted on bios department servers, and any issues should be forwarded to bios IT.  

Grading scale:

* H: Clear excellence
* P: Entirely satisfactory
* L: Low passing
* F: Fail

The School of Public Health grading system is designed so that the
mode of the grading distribution is P. The last graded assignment will
be due on the last week of regular classes. 

*Homework policy* - students are allowed and encouraged to talk about ideas and approaches to homework problems in groups, though students should write up the code for the assignments **independently**. Copying someone else’s work is always an honor code violation.  Expulsion from the university is possible if the honor code is violated, and receiving 0% on the assignment in question is a certainty.  Late work will be penalized at 10% per week late.
